### 👋 Glad to see you! **Yiming (baisebaoma) Tang** here.

⌨️ Undergraduate of **<font color="#1C2A67">University of Nottingham Ningbo China</font>**, working for a start-up as a **front-end developer** and a technical media company as a **designer**. Enjoy 🎵 and 🎹 as well.

✒️ My previous background is mainly related to **graphic design**, while I am moving to **software development** and **computer science**. Learning `react-native🌸`, `Python🐍` and `Java☕️`.

🏫 I've received some postgraduate offers. When my MSc finished, I hope to get into **<font color="#B42B36">Carnegie Mellon University🌟</font>** for a **further** Master degree or PhD. Seems quite unrealistic but let's dream big and work hard.

#### Possible research interests

- Software Engineering
- Human-Computer Interaction
- Computer Security & Cyber Security
- Computer Vision

Since I have no papers/articles, I assume them to be my **possible** research interests. I will explore these areas more and hopefully I would make contributions to them. You will be highly appreciated if you can guide me a road!
