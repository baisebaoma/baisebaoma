### 👋 Glad to see you! I am **Yiming (baisebaoma) Tang**.

⌨️ Undergraduate of **<font color="#1C2A67">University of Nottingham Ningbo China</font>**, working for a start-up as a **front-end developer** and a we-media company as a **designer**. Enjoy 🎵 and 🎹 as well.

✒️ My previous background is mainly related to **graphic design**, while I am moving to **software engineering** and **computer science**. Learning `react-native🌸`, `Python🐍` and `Java☕️`.

🏫 Now I've received the postgraduate offer from University of Sydney, University of Nottingham and University of Sheffield and am considering carefully from them. When my MSc finished, I hope to get into **<font color="#B42B36">Carnegie Mellon University🌟</font>** ~~in 10 years~~, for a Master degree or PhD. It seems quite unrealistic but let's dream big and work hard. ([Really?](https://github.com/baisebaoma/no-bailan))

**~~Possible~~ research interests**

- Software Engineering
- Human-Computer Interaction
- Computer Security & Cyber Security
- Computer Vision

Since I have no papers/articles, I assume them to be my **possible** research interests. I will explore these areas more and hopefully I would make contributions to them. You will be highly appreciated if you can guide me a road!
